# Description

The tidy dataset produced by the run_analysis.R script contains the average of fitness sensor variables for each fitness activity and each subject in the experiment. See the README.txt in the raw dataset for details about the experiment.

# Variables

The tidy data contains the following variables:

* Subject ID: id for each participant in the fitness experiment. The range is 1 to 30.

* Class Description: There were six activities performed in the experiment: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

* 66 mean and standard deviation variables for each fitness measurement. From the raw dataset, variables containing "mean()" and "sd()" in the raw dataset variable name were extracted. The values in the tidy dataset are the averages of the data with that variable name in the raw dataset for each subject and each activity.


# Note

Since there are 30 subjects and six activities, there are 180 total computed means for each of the 66 mean and standard deviation variables. Thus the resulting tidy dataset is a 180 x 68 dataframe.
